# Docker Ecosystem

Docker is used to host applications for local use, reachable only via home network. All applications will have their own specific `docker-compose` files in order to allow updates and upgrades to affect only the app they touch.

## Applications
| Application | `docker-compose` File |
| --- | --- |
| Anchore | [anchore-compose.yml](anchore-compose.yml) |
| ELK Stack | |
| Plex | |
| TeamCity | |
